                Come, Holy Spirit, Creator blest,<br>
                and in our souls take up Thy rest;<br>
                come with Thy grace and heavenly aid<br>
                to fill the hearts which Thou hast made.
            </p>
            <p>
                O comforter, to Thee we cry,<br>
                O heavenly gift of God Most High,<br>
                O fount of life and fire of love,<br>
                and sweet anointing from above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thou in Thy sevenfold gifts are known;<br>
                Thou, finger of God's hand we own;<br>
                Thou, promise of the Father,<br>
                Thou Who dost the tongue with power imbue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kindle our sense from above,<br>
                and make our hearts o'erflow with love;<br>
                with patience firm and virtue high<br>
                the weakness of our flesh supply.
            </p>
            <p>
                Far from us drive the foe we dread,<br>
                and grant us Thy peace instead;<br>
                so shall we not, with Thee for guide,<br>
                turn from the path of life aside.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, may Thy grace on us bestow<br>
                the Father and the Son to know;<br>
                and Thee, through endless times confessed,<br>
                of both the eternal Spirit blest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now to the Father and the Son,<br>
                Who rose from death, be glory given,<br>
                with Thou, O Holy Comforter,<br>
                henceforth by all in earth and heaven. Amen.

                My soul doth magnify the Lord. And my spirit hath<br>
                rejoiced in God my Savior. Because He hath<br>
                regarded the humility of His handmaid; for behold,<br>
                from henceforth all generations shall call me<br>
                blessed. Because He that is mighty hath done great<br>
                things to me; and holy is His name. And His mercy is<br>
                from generation to generations, to them that fear<br>
                Him. He hath showed might in His arm; He hath<br>
                scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.<br>
                He hath put down the mighty from their seat; and<br>
                hath exalted the humble. He hath filled the hungry<br>
                with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty<br>
                away. He hath received Israel His servant, being<br>
                mindful of His mercy. As He spoke to our fathers, to<br>
                Abraham and to his seed forever. Amen.
