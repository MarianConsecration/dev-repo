            @* This is a continuation of "On the Fervent Amendment of our Whole Life" from Chapter 25. *@

            <div class="scripture-text">
                <p>But if You observe anything worthy of reproof, beware You do not the same. And if at any time You have done it, labor quickly to amend yourself. As your eye observes others, so are You by others noted again.</p>
                <p>How sweet and pleasant a thing it is, to see brethren fervent and devout, obedient and well-disciplined! How sad and grievous a thing it is, to see them walk disorderly, not applying themselves to that for which they are called! How hurtful a thing it is, when they neglect the purpose of their calling and busy themselves in things not committed to their care!</p>
                <p>Be mindful of the purpose You have embraced, and set always before You the image of the Crucified. Good cause You have to be ashamed in looking upon the life of Jesus Christ, seeing You have not as yet endeavored to conform yourself more unto Him, though You have been a long time in the way of God. A religious person that exercises himself seriously and devoutly in the most holy life and passion of our Lord, shall there abundantly find whatsoever is profitable and necessary for him, neither shall he need to seek any better thing, besides Jesus. O if Jesus crucified would come into our hearts, how quickly and fully should we be. A man fervent and diligent is prepared for all things.</p>
                <p>It is harder toil to resist vices and passions, than to sweat in bodily labors. He that avoids not small faults, by little and little fall into greater ones. You will always rejoice in the evening, if You spend the day profitably. Be watchful over yourself, stir up yourself, warn yourself, and whatsoever becometh of others, neglect not yourself. The more violent you use against yourself, the more you shall progress. Amen.</p>
