    <article class="scripture-reading my-4">
        <h2 class="scripture-reference h4 mb-3" style="color: var(--primary-color);">Reading: Matthew 5:1-19</h2>
        <div class="scripture-text">
            <p>When he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain, and after he had sat down, his disciples came to him. He began to teach them, saying:</p>
            <p>
                “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
                Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.<br>
                Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land.<br>
                Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.<br>
                Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.<br>
                Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God.<br>
                Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.<br>
                Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
            </p>
            <p>Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. Thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>
            <p>“You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and then put it under a bushel basket; it is set on a lampstand, where it gives light to all in the house. Just so, your light must shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys and teaches these commandments will be called greatest in the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
