                <p>For what reason, but I did know well, how to cast from me all human comfort, either for the sake of devotion, or through the necessity by which I am compelled to seek You, because there is no man that can comfort me. Then might I deservedly hope in Your favor, and rejoice in the gift of a new consolation. Thanks be to You from Whom all things proceed, as often as it happens to me. I, indeed, am but vanity, and nothing in Your sight , an inconstant and weak man. Where, therefore, can I glory, or for what do I desire to be thought of highly?</p>
                <p>Indeed of my very nothingness; and this is most vain. Truly vainglory is an evil plague, because it draws away from true glory, and robs us of heavenly grace. For, while a man takes complacency in himself, he displeases You; while he wants for human applause, he is deprived of true virtues. But true, glory and holy exultation is to glory in You, and not in one's self; to rejoice in Your Name, but not in one's own strength. To find pleasure in no creature, save only for Your sake. Let Your Name be praised, not mine; let Your work be magnified, not mine; let Your Holy Name be blessed, but let nothing be attributed to me of the praise of men. You are my glory; You are the exultation of my heart; in You, will I glory and rejoice all the day; but for myself, I will glory in nothing but in my infirmities.</p>
