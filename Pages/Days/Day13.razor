        <div class="theme-text">
            <p>Prayers, examinations, reflection, acts of renouncement of our own will, of contrition for our sins, of contempt of self, all performed at the feet of Mary, for it is from her that we hope for light to know ourselves. It is near her, that we shall be able to measure the abyss of our miseries without despairing.</p>
            <p>We should employ all our pious actions in asking for a knowledge of ourselves and contrition of our sins: and we should do this in a spirit of piety. During this period, we shall consider not so much the opposition that exists between the spirit of Jesus and ours, but the miserable and humiliating state to which our sins have reduced us. Moreover, the True Devotion being an easy, short, sure and perfect way to arrive at that union with Our Lord which is Christlike perfection, we shall enter seriously upon this way, strongly convinced of our misery and helplessness. But how to attain this without a knowledge of ourselves?</p>

        <h2 class="scripture-reference h4 mb-3" style="color: var(--primary-color);">Reading: Luke 11:1-10</h2>
        <div class="scripture-text">
            <p>It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, when He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.” And He said to them, “When you pray, say:</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
                ‘Father, hallowed be Your name.<br>
                Your kingdom come.<br>
                Give us each day our daily bread.<br>
                And forgive us our sins,<br>
                For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.<br>
                And do not lead us into temptation.’”
            </p>
            <p>And He said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, because a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to serve him’; and from inside he answers and says, ‘Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.’ I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything just because he is his friend, yet because of his shamelessness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</p>
            <p>“So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.”</p>
