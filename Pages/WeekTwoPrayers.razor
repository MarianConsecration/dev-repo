                <p>
                    Hail Mary, beloved Daughter of the Eternal Father!<br>
                    Hail Mary, admirable Mother of the Son!<br>
                    Hail Mary, faithful spouse of the Holy Ghost!<br>
                    Hail Mary, my dear Mother, my loving Mistress, my powerful sovereign!
                </p>
                <p>Hail my joy, my glory, my heart and my soul!</p>
                <p>You are all mine by mercy, and I am all yours by justice. But I am not yet sufficiently yours. I now give myself wholly to You without keeping anything back for myself or others. If You still see in me anything which does not belong to you, I beseech You to take it and to make yourself the absolute Mistress of all that is mine. Destroy in me all that may be displeasing to God, root it up and bring it to nought; place and cultivate in me everything that is pleasing to you.</p>
                <p>May the light of your faith dispel the darkness of my mind; may your profound humility take the place of my pride; may your sublime contemplation check the distractions of my wandering imagination; may your continuous sight of God fill my memory with His presence; may the burning love of your heart inflame the lukewarmness of mine; may your virtues take the place of my sins; may your merits be my only adornment in the sight of God and make up for all that is wanting in me. Finally, dearly beloved Mother, grant, if it be possible, that I may have no other spirit but yours to know Jesus and His divine will; that I may have no other soul but yours to praise and glorify the Lord; that I may have no other heart but yours to love God with a love as pure and ardent as yours. I do not ask you for visions, revelations, sensible devotion or spiritual pleasures. It is your privilege to see God clearly; it is your privilege to enjoy heavenly bliss; it is your privilege to triumph gloriously in Heaven at the right hand of your Son and to hold absolute sway over angels, men and demons; it is your privilege to dispose of all the gifts of God, just as You will. Such is, O heavenly Mary, the "best part," which the Lord has given You and which shall never be taken away from you — and this thought fills my heart with joy. As for my part here below, I wish for no other than that which was yours: to believe sincerely without spiritual pleasures; to suffer joyfully without human consolation; to die continually to myself without respite; and to work zealously and unselfishly for You until death as the humblest of your servants. The only grace I beg You to obtain for me is that every day and every moment of my life I may say: Amen, so be it's all that You did while on earth; Amen, so be it's all that You are now doing in Heaven; Amen, so be it to all that You are doing in my soul, so that You alone may fully glorify Jesus in me for time and eternity. Amen.</p>

            <div class="prayer-text">
                <p>
                    Hail Mary, beloved Daughter of the Eternal Father!<br>
                    Hail Mary, admirable Mother of the Son!<br>
                    Hail Mary, faithful spouse of the Holy Ghost!<br>
                    Hail Mary, my dear Mother, my loving Mistress, my powerful sovereign!
                </p>
                <p>Hail my joy, my glory, my heart and my soul!</p>
                <p>You are all mine by mercy, and I am all yours by justice. But I am not yet sufficiently yours. I now give myself wholly to You without keeping anything back for myself or others. If You still see in me anything which does not belong to you, I beseech You to take it and to make yourself the absolute Mistress of all that is mine. Destroy in me all that may be displeasing to God, root it up and bring it to nought; place and cultivate in me everything that is pleasing to you.</p>
                <p>May the light of your faith dispel the darkness of my mind; may your profound humility take the place of my pride; may your sublime contemplation check the distractions of my wandering imagination; may your continuous sight of God fill my memory with His presence; may the burning love of your heart inflame the lukewarmness of mine; may your virtues take the place of my sins; may your merits be my only adornment in the sight of God and make up for all that is wanting in me. Finally, dearly beloved Mother, grant, if it be possible, that I may have no other spirit but yours to know Jesus and His divine will; that I may have no other soul but yours to praise and glorify the Lord; that I may have no other heart but yours to love God with a love as pure and ardent as yours. I do not ask you for visions, revelations, sensible devotion or spiritual pleasures. It is your privilege to see God clearly; it is your privilege to enjoy heavenly bliss; it is your privilege to triumph gloriously in Heaven at the right hand of your Son and to hold absolute sway over angels, men and demons; it is your privilege to dispose of all the gifts of God, just as You will. Such is, O heavenly Mary, the "best part," which the Lord has given You and which shall never be taken away from you — and this thought fills my heart with joy. As for my part here below, I wish for no other than that which was yours: to believe sincerely without spiritual pleasures; to suffer joyfully without human consolation; to die continually to myself without respite; and to work zealously and unselfishly for You until death as the humblest of your servants. The only grace I beg You to obtain for me is that every day and every moment of my life I may say: Amen, so be it's all that You did while on earth; Amen, so be it's all that You are now doing in Heaven; Amen, so be it to all that You are doing in my soul, so that You alone may fully glorify Jesus in me for time and eternity. Amen.</p>
